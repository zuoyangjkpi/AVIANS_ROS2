YOLO GPU Detection Fix
======================

The issue might be in the YOLO C++ code or Python binding. Here are potential fixes:

1. **Check YOLO12.hpp/cpp GPU detection logic**:
   - Look for GPU availability check
   - Ensure it uses the same ONNX Runtime version
   - Check if it's using hardcoded provider lists

2. **Environment variables to try**:
   export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
   export ORT_TENSORRT_ENGINE_CACHE_ENABLE=1
   export ORT_TENSORRT_CACHE_PATH=/tmp/trt_cache

3. **Force GPU in YOLO parameters**:
   - Check if there's a force_gpu parameter
   - Look for provider_options in the code

4. **Potential code fix locations**:
   - src/neural_network_detector/src/yolo12_detector_node.cpp
   - src/neural_network_detector/third_party/YOLOs-CPP/include/det/YOLO12.hpp

5. **Quick workaround**:
   Since your environment is correct, the issue is likely in YOLO's GPU detection.
   The CPU fallback should still work - focus on getting CPU version working first.
